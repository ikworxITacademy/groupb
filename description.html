<!--the above is an example of a code tha uses a definition list and a nested list, that is system similar to how a dictonary works and shows you a description. you can place an ordered or unordered list anywhere as long as you close it appropriate. Inside the oredered list in an unoredered list within the description . dl comes 1st then dt then dd, list then title, then desciption with entries as you require. title goes within the lits with multiple entires nut you cant have multiple list>
